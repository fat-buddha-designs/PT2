These insects play an important role in the pollination of flowers and vegetables and pest control, contributing overall to the health of our gardens, landscapes, and ecosystems.\n\nInsects are a part of the food chain and so can also provide great food sources for birds and other wildlife that are a welcome part of any balanced natural environment.\n\n\\### What is an insect house and what does it look like?\n\nAn insect house, sometimes called also an insect hotel, is a structure from diverse natural or recycled materials that imitates natural nesting habitat for insects. Insect houses come in a variety of shapes and sizes, featuring different elements to suit the needs of specific insect species.\n\nFor example:\n\n\\- Solitary bees prefer small holes in wood or plant stems (even bamboo) They love our Bee Logs!\n\\- Beetles like cavities in rotting logs\n\\- Ladybugs choose to hibernate among dry sticks covered with leaves or pine cones\n\\- Lacewings seek dry grass, straw mixtures or layered cardboard\n\nBy combining diverse materials and placing them accordingly, you can achieve a balanced colony of beneficial insects. Once the insect house is discovered, insects will nest and reproduce inside as well as hibernate there during the winter, only to come out strong as soon as the spring starts.\n\nSo, your garden’s health will be kept at check by these little helpers since the first warm days.\n\n\\### Siting Your Insect House\n\nWhen considering where to site an Insect House, it is important to ensure that it is placed in a sheltered spot away from strong winds or direct sunlight.\n\nIt should also be placed near flowering plants or shrubs so that the insects will have access to food sources.\n\nBy providing these Insect Houses with suitable locations and resources we can help ensure that our gardens remain healthy and productive.\n","Category":"Insect","PublishedDate":"2022-11-11","Published":true,"Image":[{"id":"attIY8t4J4evrNFzC","width":474,"height":319,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v2/23/23/1702483200000/vx0Ve2Xs88ssP-0xbOfYdw/4zIfQlupfw4bRXH4I_uTVhWLBSw5lmCqZitrKl9FDxRZR4bO8cLNFMQ9IQKj_NIun1hPWCTwNN0CGHowjeZNCLC9O_ysDEpB1RWBlZoj4L58snn42wetx-ujptcvAt7l50ViGQGQY5d6SiC7-CDhp5eGK-HIqJiZP3UaaUcZHRo/wIl3uN8-3yvi9WOJVMcj28tuTAbYLPahMNKorDnEflg","filename":"insect-hotel.jpg","size":44720,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v2/23/23/1702483200000/vktiVvpO0yvS86MxDlHn6g/BpPc-o3FrLlX3yF9-4QBXkkva9kVC67cF63Nf5BiLlLnbe1ToMLo4Lz5u-WY8psxKgOdQBnOYb5vB6KhUQpQTC7OZh-_2eVemX9c9nY6N-zh87bGRwLnBldjjAWJLKVnBQtewsUD5aOUNIcJgl4YCQ/MpzWjMMcfKSyAcdwsLZXXb_bXH8vov9oxF1c5o8k7RI","width":53,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v2/23/23/1702483200000/xMinI89x0t7v44K4ms8I5Q/UphResr13pUBtMHvkNdlIiutsd7qtdQRotf76DeN7GpZD-Ca6oMxENNKeBg9N0H5q61pCozaTC8NWWjdViw2GRFUm2yYS1JyTUTNmweIwvlFaB6jUYpeiNAcxVzg7_A5ksYGPCCXegB9IRJlLC0Oew/OEDHxDol7CKrIEobA1GH5u95a6pkWWh4YWfwj4-c-hs","width":474,"height":319},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v2/23/23/1702483200000/lkgwiaZoCZIgJUdWtTjRUQ/qjSG14N3rx3gLa__KX2QR43RiTlyUXG-9kWQLUPn41ylt32JlgYNnat2vx4axLw4TdLcmayJKOiqawSMul1VobTXGHuXB8rtVMDL5OLRPCJsl4327ShT58k5wAea4dEoY4qIsIT9R4P-83GB-oOKhg/6Q6z9aur7PmJ4leXq5eakBgD8yNCEE6RJsY2Mi_Ddg4","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Keywords":["Insect","Houses","Insect Houses"],"ImageAlt":"Insect Hotel","Description":"Insect Houses are an important part of the natural environment, providing shelter and a habitat for beneficial insects.","Tag":"article","Title":"The Importance Of Insect Houses"},{"id":"recLoAg5XdQ2ZogGL","Content":"\\## How To Look After Your Outdoor Wooden Products\n\nSo you have a lovely wooden Bird Box or Insect Hotel and don't know the best way to care for and increase the longevity of it.\n\n\\### The Benefits of Care for your Wooden Products\n\n\\### Has the Wood been treated before?\n\nIf the wood has previously been treated with a preservative it is probably best to carry on with the same treatment. For our painted products we use Cuprinol Garden Shades Black Ash, this offers 6 full years of weather protection on garden wood and produces a matt colour that enhances the wood grain.\n\nTo apply any paint or stain it is important to first remove any surface dust and dirt to ensure the product you are using adheres to the surface. So you will need to wire brush or sand down the surface to remove any loose items and to give a smooth surface.\n\nOnce you have a clean, dry item ready for it's treatment then choose a well ventilated area to apply whatever treatment you choose.\n\nAs a benefit to the environment I would suggest that water based treatments are the better option.\n\n\\### If the Wood is untreated\n\nIf the wood has not been treated before, then you will be better off applying a wood preservative before any surface finish treatment such as a paint or stain.\n\nAgain, it's important to prepare the surface first before applying any preservative.\n\n\\### Insect & Bird Houses\n\nProducts that are to become a home to insects or birds are probably best not being painted or stained as the products may well be toxic if ingested.\n\nOur bee logs are made from logs cut straight from trees and our bee houses only have stain on the roof section. Logic would suggest that insects and birds would not eat anything including treated wood that would be harmful to them, but it's best to reduce the chance of this happening.\n","Category":"Displays","PublishedDate":"2022-12-02","Published":true,"Image":[{"id":"att2BhD75I1SP1buQ","width":2016,"height":1512,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v2/23/23/1702483200000/kS0_XcnPQgLGtkBdlVr2Dg/vujKs4Wkk1yZVSpAkIY9EA3D-ugeGjGFW-a0bIO5LBkVWqMvV71yG6FFCtct_u2RYIInAEfwM4597HP17hBWtfxxCfFGOC9cWN0b7WFDgoOa9SSYHmYG3Hv-fwSp_8w8VOWba6t7IMrLEQbVq1_MX1cRBKdvofBa-OnWXVykuiw0kjtoMKVXX2zTMZxOK9mZ/KGjfqj0PIz_qCMDKlM1lY54uvBUnX94HI2kC8JDoaYY","filename":"two-shelf-wide-plant-theatre.jpg","size":370043,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v2/23/23/1702483200000/gNv9MAUdXalGZSon-WH9-A/jX1oKbwcHa1rdxcPVbJz7w_qfUCIENY-5l84FMYLKs7Y6e3jxswLftLArqj6MWiHk_F08MMxME9ezT8u9EhE3vuSM4U4aDhmPRgOdb5114weovs1oSvGnLzUVqQovm6xhx9_eptnQkXYG3z98466pA/ObuIljATvKSjMRbXG4IEG0IZMsRYrZfabw_idRAzPm4","width":27,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v2/23/23/1702483200000/OfB1qtT1ZDP5NiHmRjCnSQ/9wcX4vcaDUI3PV_z0C0wtHAoG-itUO481aWrSw0qN62chjg-IVzSGehBHSlo9HnB9bZnIDK3t4rgx1df_IJaWmdAnER-NgMGKeJxLkLfQpK0Yxoqkb7qDJ2W3GieO0lyuoparAdyc4lNJTCZR4ftcw/L4hJz1VQm-Zw9biOLSbS5JIcBVp5v8zzU7iD-zpyxeA","width":512,"height":683},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v2/23/23/1702483200000/jKgTEEMwo70t2cu3Hyibbg/TqO8KuqPW1IHZQcLSg35wejIrfgAr6xUnJZ8kPfcaPaGQ8iqiN5R-JJ0FUR5aOQ6b59JcINgmDyaRH840IKY0Lx2cV4-EAm61Ke5bc2KBwt54WA7ZSddZRANbR0pFHfWLgF7RnY8InQJVPG-2zoDIw/2-15xavBPf3EG4ap6tRkdp8sUJlNPMRR40Dw8bxaMt8","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Keywords":["Care","Wooden","Caring For Wooden Products"],"ImageAlt":"A two shelf wood Plant Theatre manufactured from decking.","Description":"So you have a lovely wooden Bird Box or Insect Hotel and don't know","Tag":"article","Title":"Caring For Your Wooden Products"},{"id":"rec1kQxEQjRB9IPOd","Content":"\\## Which is the best aspect for bird boxes?\n\nFirstly, birds choose different types of home in which to build their nests. Some birds, such as blue tits like a snug fitting hole to squeeze through. Others, such as nuthatches, prefer finding a larger cavity and then back filling it with a mud and saliva mix. Others still, prefer an open site that gives them visibility of potential predators approaching.\n\nSecondly, different birds have preferred locations and heights at which they like to nest. Even direction of entry and exit from the nest makes a difference. For example, treecreepers like the feel of tree bark under their toes and therefore won’t use a smooth timber nest box!\n\n\\### What are the best bird boxes for different birds?\n\nLet’s look at some of the preferences for a few of our common garden visitors.\n\n\\- Blue tits like a nest box with a hole about 25-26mm diameter at a height between 2-4 meters high.\n\\- Great tits prefer a nest box with a hole 28-32mm diameter and at a height of 4-6 meters.\n\\- House Sparrows are communal nesters preferring to make nests close to one another. Under the eaves of houses and with holes about 32-34mm diameter.\n\\- Starlings like house sparrows prefer to nest under the eaves of houses but with holes about 45mm diameter.\n\\- Robins like deep undergrowth or low hollows in trees and therefore like a nest box low to the ground, about a meter high, with a fully open front.\n\\- Blackbirds often build nests in trees but will happily adopt a nest box, if it has good front and side visibility, in a quiet spot about 1-2 meters high.\n\\- House sparrows and starlings will readily use nest boxes placed high up under the eaves. Since these birds nest in loose colonies, two or three can be sited spaced out on the same side of the house. Keep these away from areas where house martins normally nest.\n\\- Unless there are trees or buildings which shade the box during the day, face the box between north and east, thus avoiding strong sunlight and the wettest winds.\n\\- Make sure that the birds have a clear flight path to the nest without any clutter directly in front of the entrance. Tilt the box forward slightly so that any driving rain will hit the roof and bounce clear.\n\\- Two boxes close together may be occupied by the same species if they are at the edge of adjoining territories and there is plenty of natural food. While this readily happens in the countryside, it is rare in gardens, where you normally can only expect one nesting pair of any one species. The exceptions to this are house and tree sparrows and house martins, which are colonial nesters. By putting up different boxes, several species can be attracted.\n\n\\### Attaching your Bird box\n\nBefore you put up your nest box, remember to keep in mind the following:\n\nFixing your nest box with nails may damage the tree. It is better to attach it either with a nylon bolt or with wire around the trunk or branch. Use a piece of hose or section of car tyre around the wire to prevent damage to the tree. Remember that trees grow in girth as well as height, and check the fixing every two or three years.\n\nOpen-fronted boxes for robins and wrens need to be low down, below 2m, well hidden in vegetation. Those for spotted flycatchers need to be 2-4m high, sheltered by vegetation but with a clear outlook. Woodpecker boxes need to be 3-5m high on a tree trunk with a clear flight path and away from disturbance.\n\nNest boxes are best put up during the autumn. Many birds will enter nest boxes during the autumn and winter, looking for a suitable place to roost or perhaps to feed. They often use the same boxes for nesting the following spring. Tits will not seriously investigate nesting sites until February or March.\n\nAnother method of attaching to trees is to fix an adjustable strap and buckle to the bird box that can then be loosened with each season to accommodate the trees change in girth with its growth.\n\n\\### Which direction should a bird nesting box face?\n\nBird nest boxes should ideally face between north and east. This will catch morning sunshine but avoid the heat of the midday sun. It will also keep them out of our prevailing wind and rain which usually comes from the west in the case of mainland UK. The bird nest box should ideally also be tilted marginally forward to allow any rain to run clear of the entrance or purchase a box that has an overhang. This all helps create a more suitable and safe environment for eggs and growing birds.\nBut having said all this, I have seen nest boxes occupied and they face directly south, so I guess birds don't really mind at all.\n\n\\### What time of year should you site a bird nest box?\n\nGarden birds will look for places to roost or store food during the winter, often returning to nest in the spring. For this reason, siting your nest box in late autumn or early winter is ideal. However, there’s never really a bad time to site a nest box as each season brings a different use.\n","Category":"Bird","PublishedDate":"2022-12-28","Published":true,"Image":[{"id":"attu7DwSJXRq5ctnP","width":500,"height":333,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v2/23/23/1702483200000/-RYlwBiW_rvDTKS_xfOOHQ/8YzekR1AK6lACLdo1QdfeWiJaddyFsHko2XGHM5nbY1ivHYtqgxLFTHylVjosJUOFBWuyiaJkBNRBqygywgyQK5vBW7tlz0AH-y9gMYu3luji8H8RDTVNe5r6zyRouroWzoM09n1dREwq4npea2KBBfvoenf9btgFlDmwWG1wd8/gjiKc4U9gxXHCx7gh89rnr20FbB1JWURG3SzOdn6o4Q","filename":"nesting-box-in-a-tree.jpg","size":40807,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v2/23/23/1702483200000/iX7DDt5_PHiQBbZediXirQ/dwcfuoglj77iTH9AIRmvqQWaVAMkwnHVjonGBRAO3P_Kc5GI3zh-h0sCBeRRARfjUCJRcB0jwzXNp6uwEsqug8vnZ8Ue9_bf4qibVZet5FKHLF4vTwoAAyHmIArMpSMJdnF7su1Wa3C05l2nfZz69g/Q7iSPmTLSOrqSgWGvwPa8q50J35MIcaOUbWHRgRxCcE","width":54,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v2/23/23/1702483200000/4ldFMvQ-2Rv-vPwOpWUQMg/ZM3vF-SUQzxmepXqKmSoU0ZdwY2XEO5ORbWZGmE31XdzW5D_GxY7CdwisBI9J1KO9kYHm7R0eR4Mi5aiB2DAObINENO38LjI0ATKITS8KbQnYvi1Nf117jx1oeozvQaIfRGNHubj4z0s-dQlqjoYEA/FYyFjJkwy9IQoR92em-m4UoMaXFoxu6qgAGcfSxCJ2Q","width":500,"height":333},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v2/23/23/1702483200000/K6EVZUfcX9veBf2sXA_nRw/GT77Qv-pd-jqu6a5Nhdub4SWphsvfwxjCCHYah0HCAcmD1itErjbMBr-jddQAhKPir3ZHc0oGS2Uf6ohQMjpYW7o-iBZjDEgx_sD0u_NiiYuhktjqHfjCcr2WII-8pzobK_3STF0HVpEJapPOul6_A/PVR0WnZK8nWV_Lnut__LSlTs8BOPYCjDEslYBCpk190","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Keywords":["Bird","Boxes","Siting A Bird Box"],"ImageAlt":"Wooden Bird Box In Tree","Description":"  the best way to care for and increase the longevity of it.","Tag":"article","Title":"Siting Your Bird Boxes"},{"id":"rec66fDJI19BNDf1x","Content":"\\## What is an Auricula Theatre?\n\nAn Auricula theatre is the traditional way of displaying these lovely antique flowers, instantly adding to their romantic atmosphere. A theatre usually has multiple shelves or layers to best display your Auricula's. Some theatres are painted a darker colour to give the colourful flowers maximum impact. We manufacture a range of theatre's that you can view on our \\[Products]\\(</products/>) page.\n\nWe do swap out Our Auricula's once they have finished flowering and replace them with either herbs or succulents.\n\n\\### Which direction should an Auricula Theatre face?\n\nYour Auricula plants should not be permanently kept in the theatre throughout the year as this environment does not provide enough all-round light, but they can be put into position when a plant is just about to come into flower. The best place to put your theatre is on a cool, northerly wall out of strong sunlight.\n\n\\### What size pots are best for an Auricula Theatre?\n\nAuriculas should be grown in as small a pot as possible to keep their roots restricted. A 9cm (3½”) pot is normally the maximum size used for shows and exhibiting Auricula's.
