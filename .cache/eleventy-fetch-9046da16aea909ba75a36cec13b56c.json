We also decided to use all stainless steel fixings and hardware, which, although more expensive than plain steel, ensures the longevity of the final product.\n\nOnce we had started on the journey of making plant theatres, it became apparent that we needed to make other products to use up all the offcuts, hence why we now make a range of products, including plant display stands, bird boxes, bee houses, and insect houses. You can find our range on the <a aria-label=\"head to our products page for all our steel and wood products\" href=\"/products/\">products page</a>.\n\nWe hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy making them.\n","Title":"About Us","permalink":"/about/","Description":"Learn just a little bit about why we started to manufacture plant theatres and other quality garden products."},{"id":"recT4lDzR39MXHDi2","Keywords":["Policies","Accessibility Policy","Cookies Policy","Privacy Policy"],"layout":"default","Content":"## Our Policy Statement\n\n- <a aria-label=\"head to our accessibility policy\" href=\"/policies/#accessibility\">Accessibility Policy</a>\n- <a aria-label=\"head to our cookies policy\" href=\"/policies/#cookies\">Cookies Policy</a>\n- <a aria-label=\"head to our privacy policy\" href=\"/policies/#privacy\">Privacy Policy</a>\n\n### <a id=\"accessibility\"></a>Accessibility Policy\n\nWe’ve built this website to make it easier for all web users to contact 'Plant Theatres And More' or find out more about us.\n\n'Plant Theatres And More' is committed to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of technology or ability.\n\nWe are actively working to increase the accessibility and usability of our website and in doing so adhere to many of the available standards and guidelines.\n\nOur checkpoints are taken from the technical standard [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag), published by the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/).\n\nYou can always zoom in or out if that works better for you.\n\nPress CTRL + PLUS SIGN (+) to zoom in.\n\nPress CTRL + HYPHEN (-) to zoom out.\n\nWe have added ALT tags to all images, ALT Tags are invisible descriptions of images that are read aloud to blind users on a screen reader. Adding ALT text allows us to include images, but still provide the content in an alternative text-based format.

ARIA is a set of special accessibility attributes which can be added to any mark-up but is especially suited to HTML. The role attribute defines what the general type of object is (such as an article, alert, or slider).\n\nThe aria-label attribute is used to define a string that labels the current element. Use it in cases where a text label is not visible on the screen.\n\nThe aria-hidden attribute is used to hide elements, such as icon names; that would otherwise make following a web page difficult for screen readers.\n\nWe have included a Language Tag, this tag is designed to signal screen readers pronunciation engines which language to use.\n\n### <a id=\"cookies\"></a>Cookies Policy\n\nCookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit.\n\nWhen you view this website, we may store some information on your computer in the form of a cookie file (referred to here as “Cookies”), which will enable us to tailor the site to improve your browsing experience.\n\nWe try to limit the number of cookies we use and only use those necessary to enable you to have a pleasurable browsing experience.\n\n**The Cookies we use on the Site can be described as follows:**\n\nCMSSESSID\\\\[unique id] - used to maintain continuity as you move between pages in the Site and expire when you close your web browser.\n\nWe don't use any Third-Party Analytics.\n\n### <a id=\"privacy\"></a>Privacy Policy\n\nThis privacy policy forms part of the <a aria-label=\"head to our terms of use page\" href=\"/terms-of-use/\">terms of use</a> that govern your use of the 'Plant Theatres And More' website.\n\nIn May 2018, the original Data Protection Act 1998 was replaced by General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
