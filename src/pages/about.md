## A Little Bit About Us

Hi, my name is Will Moody, and along with my wife Linda, we own and run Plant Theatres & More.

We first came up with the idea of making plant theatres after we struggled to find one to purchase to display our collection of Auriculas.

We decided to use decking for the construction of the theatres as it is readily available and is pressure treated, ensuring a long life for our products. We also decided to use all stainless steel fixings and hardware, which, although more expensive than plain steel, ensures the longevity of the final product.

Once we had started on the journey of making plant theatres, it became apparent that we needed to make other products to use up all the offcuts, hence why we now make a range of products, including plant display stands, bird boxes, bee houses, and insect houses. You can find our range on the [Products page](/products/).

We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy making them.
