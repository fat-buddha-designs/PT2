  <p>We manufacture a range of quality wooden and steel garden-related products from our workshop near Norwich, in Norfolk. Our main product range is plant theatres or display stands, bee houses, insect houses, bird boxes and a range of steel sculptures.</p>

  <p>Insects and birds are struggling with a loss of suitable places to breed, so any little bit you can do to help will make a positive change, so to view our full range of products, including nesting boxes and insect hotels please go to the <a href="/products/" aria-label="product page">products</a> page.</p>

  <p>Our wooden products are all made from thick pressure-treated wood with a couple of exceptions, and all the fixings used are stainless steel, ensuring you many years of pleasure from our products.</p>

  <p>Our range of hand-made steel products are all made from un-treated mild steel, these will all rust unless treated to give a lovely warm patina but years of enjoyment too.</p>

  <p>As we are a small business, we can offer a bespoke design service for some of our products, especially the screening panels, you can find out more about these on the products page.</p>

  <p>We sell our range of products at various maker and garden events around Norfolk and Suffolk, you can find details about where to catch up
